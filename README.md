## ðŸ”§ Notebook Contents

The `solarpowerprediction.ipynb` includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Training and comparing multiple regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression)  
- Model evaluation and performance metrics  
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values
